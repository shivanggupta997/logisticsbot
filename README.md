---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

-   Git
-   Python 3.13 (or the version specified in your project)
-   pip (Python package installer)
-   Docker (for containerized deployment)
-   (Optional) A virtual environment tool like `venv` or `conda`.

### 1. Local Development (Without Docker)

Follow these steps to run the application on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shivanggupta997/logisticsbot.git
    cd logisticsbot
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    # venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    (Assuming you have a `requirements.txt` file)
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *If `requirements.txt` is missing, you might need to create it from your development environment or install Django and other dependencies manually (e.g., `pip install django ...`).*

4.  **Apply database migrations:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5.  **Create a superuser (for admin access):**
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

6.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

### 2. Running with Docker

This project is Dockerized and can be run easily as a container.

#### Option A: Using the Pre-built Docker Image from Docker Hub

You can pull and run the pre-built image directly from Docker Hub:

1.  **Pull the image:**
    ```bash
    docker pull darksmiley1907/ailogibot:latest
    ```
    *(Note: Using `:latest` is common, but you can specify a version tag if available.)*

2.  **Run the container:**
    The application inside the container is configured to run on port 80.
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 80:80 --name logisticsbot_container darksmiley1907/ailogibot:latest
    ```
    -   `-d`: Run in detached mode.
    -   `-p 80:80`: Map port 80 of the host to port 80 of the container.
    -   `--name logisticsbot_container`: Assign a name to the container for easier management.

3.  **Access the application:**
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/` (or `http://<your-docker-host-ip>/` if not running locally).

#### Option B: Building and Running the Docker Image from Source

If you want to build the image yourself:

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shivanggupta997/logisticsbot.git
    cd logisticsbot
    ```

2.  **Build the Docker image:**
    This command uses the `Dockerfile` in the current directory.
    ```bash
    docker build -t logisticsbot-local .
    ```
    *(You can use `darksmiley1907/ailogibot` as the tag if you plan to push it to your Docker Hub).*

3.  **Run the container from your local build:**
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 80:80 --name logisticsbot_container logisticsbot-local
    ```

4.  **Access the application:**
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/`.

## 🐳 Docker Hub Image

The official pre-built Docker image for this project is available on Docker Hub:

**Image:** `darksmiley1907/ailogibot`

**Link:** [https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/darksmiley1907/ailogibot](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/darksmiley1907/ailogibot)

You can pull it using:
```bash
docker pull darksmiley1907/ailogibot:latest
```

## 🔁 Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Setup

This project includes a `Jenkinsfile` to automate the build, push to Docker Hub, and deployment processes.

### Jenkins Pipeline Stages:

1.  ✅ **Clone Repository:** Clones the source code from GitHub.
2.  🛠️ **Build Docker Image:** Builds the Docker image using the `Dockerfile` and tags it with your Docker Hub username and repository name (e.g., `darksmiley1907/ailogibot`).
3.  🚀 **Push to Docker Hub:** Pushes the built Docker image to Docker Hub. This requires Docker Hub credentials configured in Jenkins.
4.  🏁 **Deploy Container:** Stops and removes any existing container with the same name, then runs the new image as a container on port 80.


### Jenkins Setup Notes:

1.  **Install Plugins:** Ensure your Jenkins instance has the `Docker Pipeline` (or `Docker Plugin`) and `Git` plugins installed.
2.  **Docker Access:** The Jenkins agent executing the pipeline must have Docker installed and the Jenkins user must have permission to run Docker commands.
3.  **Credentials:**
    *   Create a "Username with password" credential in Jenkins for your Docker Hub account. Note its **ID** (e.g., `dockerhub-creds`) and update the `DOCKERHUB_CREDENTIALS` environment variable in the `Jenkinsfile` or pipeline configuration.
4.  **Create Pipeline Job:**
    *   Create a new "Pipeline" job in Jenkins.
    *   Configure it to use "Pipeline script from SCM".
    *   Set SCM to "Git", provide the repository URL (`https://github.com/shivanggupta997/logisticsbot.git`), and specify the branch (e.g., `main` or `master`).
    *   The "Script Path" should be `Jenkinsfile` (which is the default).

## ⚙️ Configuration & Environment Variables

The application can be configured using environment variables. These are particularly important when running in Docker or via Jenkins.

Key environment variables to consider (you might need to add these to your `Dockerfile` using `ENV` or pass them during `docker run` using `-e`):

-   `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`: **Required.** A strong, unique secret key for Django.
    *Example: `ENV DJANGO_SECRET_KEY="your_very_strong_secret_key_here"` in Dockerfile or `-e DJANGO_SECRET_KEY="value"` in `docker run`.*
-   `DEBUG`: Set to `False` for production, `True` for development.
    *Example: `ENV DEBUG="False"`*
-   `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: Comma-separated list of hostnames the app can serve. For Docker, you might need `localhost,127.0.0.1` or `*` (less secure, for development).
    *Example: `ENV ALLOWED_HOSTS="localhost,127.0.0.1,yourdomain.com"`*
-   `DATABASE_URL` (if using external DB): Connection string for your database (e.g., `postgres://user:pass@host:port/dbname`).
-   `OPENAI_API_KEY` (if using OpenAI): Your API key for OpenAI.

For local development, you can create a `.env` file in the project root and use a library like `python-dotenv` to load these variables.
**Example `.env` file:**
```
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY='your_local_secret_key'
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS='127.0.0.1,localhost'
# OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'
```
Ensure `.env` is added to your `.gitignore` file.

## 🌐 API Endpoints

The primary interaction with the chatbot typically happens via specific API endpoints.

| Method | URL             | Description                                  |
| :----- | :-------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/`             | Serves the main home/chat interface (HTML).  |
| POST   | `/api/chat/`    | (Example) Handles chatbot message submission and returns responses. (Verify actual endpoint in `urls.py`) |
| GET    | `/admin/`       | Django admin interface.                      |

*Please check your Django `app/urls.py` and `logisticsbot/urls.py` for the exact API endpoint definitions.*
